**Familiarity Theme** is a theme for [Tiger Engine](https://github.com/purkkafi/tiger-engine). It is heavily (and I mean heavily) inspired by Ren'Py's default UI, though there are differences due to how Godot's controls work. Bask in its recognizable comfort, dwell in the mysterious irony of its existence, or use it as a template for more creative themes.
